Another day, another micro blogging site where I can write about all things tech and actually never post them anywhere. Being subservient to the internet, and all things social media, it seems kinda counterintuitive to build my own blogging website given that there are literally thousands of them out there. Yet, creating something of my own does fill me with a fiery passion for a short amount of time, and I want to muster passion from anywhere I can. 
This blog is hosted on Github Pages and hence it will be free to me forever (of course minus the nominal domain charges I pay every year).

### Tools I Used To Create This Blog

- React
- Gatsby
- Tailwind CSS
- Github Pages
- Cursor IDE (chill IDE!)

The process usually revolved around being inspired by [DHH's](https://world.hey.com/dhh) blogs and then trying to create something which looked very similar to them.

### What am I gonna write about?
- Mildly interesting things about tech 
- Epiphanies from gaming and music
- To be honest, it can be any topic really, depends on the motivation of the day

I have a few old blogs written throughout various sites (Medium, Substack, LinkedIn), but just re-using those blogs to re-populate this new one is a silly idea. I want to have a bit of fresh content over here, and that's what we're gonna do!

### Sample Code Block

Here is a sample code block to demonstrate syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Arnav'));
```

Stay tuned for more...
